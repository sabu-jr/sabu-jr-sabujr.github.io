    After successfully finishing my training at the Infosys Mysore campus, I was promoted to Systems Engineer and was relocated to Infosys Trivandrum office.
    <br><br>
    In my tenure as a Systems Engineer, I worked as a DevOps Engineer in a project called "Cornerstone by Estee Lauder Companies" between August 2020 and April 2021.
    In this project I was part of a team that handled the management of CI/CD Pipelines, container orchestration and Kubernetus deployments. Working in this project gave me hands-on experience with creating and developing CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins.
    I also gained experience in automating and optimising the pipelines. As this was a Agile model project, this gave me experience in Agile software development practises.
    <br><br>
    After my Tenure in the previous project I was moved to the next project "Vendor Single Sign On by Kroger Companies", again as a DevOps Engineer between April 2021 and September 2021.
    I worked with the development team and single handedly managed the Operations side of the project. I handled Infrastructure provisioning, CI/CD Pipeline management and container orchestration in this project.
    This project was my first hands-on experience on Infrastructure provisioning using Terraform. Apart from Terrafrom, this project gave me hands-on experience in developing and maintaining CI/CD Pipelines using GitHub Actions.
