        In this Unreal Engine project titled <em>Warehouse Wreckage</em>, I developed a scene that showcases the basic physics capabilities of Unreal Engine through an engaging, interactive environment. The scene allows the player to utilize a shooting mechanism to launch black balls into a room filled with various objects, effectively demonstrating the collision and destruction of these items.

        <br>
        <h2>Key Features:</h2>
        <ul class="mirage_ul">
            <li class="mirage_li"><strong>Interactive Shooting Mechanism:</strong>The player can shoot black balls at different objects within the room, observing how the impact and force interact with the environment.</li>
            <li class="mirage_li"><strong>Blueprint Implementation:</strong>The entire project is implemented using Unreal Engine's Blueprints, ensuring an accessible and maintainable approach for developing and managing the game logic.</li>
            <li class="mirage_li"><strong>Projectile Spawning and Impulse:</strong>Functions for spawning projectiles and applying impulse to them are included in the scene. This allows for precise control over the force and direction of the projectile upon release.</li>
            <li class="mirage_li"><strong>Realistic Physics:</strong>The project demonstrates the physics engine's capabilities in Unreal Engine, allowing objects to be knocked over and interact with each other in a realistic manner.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <br>
        Overall, <em>Warehouse Wreckage</em> is a visually engaging and technically sound scene that effectively highlights the physics capabilities of Unreal Engine through interactive gameplay.
        By employing Blueprints for development, I created a clear and user-friendly demonstration of object interaction, collision, and destruction within a game environment.
        This project serves as a testament to my ability to design and implement physics-based scenes in Unreal Engine, offering a unique and immersive experience for players.
