        LUNE is a pixel horror game developed during a three-day game jam by SeriousPointGames. The game follows Luna, who, along with her dog Rufus, ventures into a haunted house to save her friend James. The house is controlled by the malevolent spirit of Clyde, who once tried to burn his family alive for an inheritance. To release Clyde's trapped spirit, players solve puzzles with the help of his grandmother’s ghost.

        My role as Gameplay Programmer involved implementing core mechanics, managing dialogue and puzzle systems, and setting up github for source control. Collaborating with a narrative writer, two pixel artists, and two sound designers, I helped bring this eerie, atmospheric experience to life.
        <h2>Key Features:</h2>
        <strong>1. Pixel Art Horror Aesthetic: </strong>Carefully crafted pixel art creates a haunting and immersive environment, enhancing the suspenseful atmosphere.<br>
        <strong>2. Engaging Dialogue System:</strong>Engaging dialogue between characters Luna and Clyde's grandmother helps unfold the story and provides clues for puzzles.<br>
        <strong>3. Puzzle-Solving Gameplay: </strong>Players encounter puzzles throughout the haunted house, which they must solve to progress and uncover the house’s secrets.<br>
        <strong>4. Narrative-Driven Exploration:</strong>A compelling story of family betrayal and unresolved spirits drives the player to explore every corner of the haunted house, piecing together the past.<br>
        <strong>5. Supernatural Companion:</strong>Luna is accompanied by her loyal dog, Rufus, and an old ghost, Florence, who provides emotional support and is part of the gameplay experience.<br>
        <strong>6. Chilling Sound Design:</strong>The atmospheric music and eerie sound effects add depth to the horror, designed to keep players on edge.<br>
        <strong>7. Spirit Interaction Mechanic:</strong>The ghost of Clyde’s grandmother acts as a guide, helping players navigate and solve puzzles, adding a unique twist to traditional horror gameplay.<br>

        <em>"LUNE "</em> is a testament to my skills in creating an immersive horror experience through pixel art, engaging narrative, and strategic gameplay mechanics. By leveraging Unity and working with a talented team, I brought a story-rich, suspenseful game to life. This project demonstrates my ability to build captivating gameplay that blends haunting visuals, atmospheric sound design, and thoughtful puzzle integration, offering players a truly immersive horror experience.
