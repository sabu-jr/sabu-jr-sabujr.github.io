        Flutter is a virtual reality game that immerses players in the life of a monarch butterfly.
        <br>
        <br>
        The graphics in the game combine realistic and stylized elements to give the player an immersive and beautiful visual experience.
        The butterfly can explore a variety of plants and flowers in the game world, which is meant to be lush and teeming with life. Shades of green, blue, and orange predominate in the scene's bright and vibrant colour scheme. 
        To give the game a sense of depth and realism, lighting effects are also used.
