        This dissertation compares three cutting-edge AI frameworks in the context of procedurally creating NPC dialogues in games: OpenAI's GPT model, Convai, and Inworld AI.
        <br>
        <br>
        This study takes a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy, taking key performance factors such as dialogue quality, contextual relevance, and real-time responsiveness (latency) into account.
        <br>
        <br>
        The findings provide essential insights into each AI framework's strengths and flaws, shining light on their practical consequences in game development.
        <br>
        <br>
        This comparative study seeks to be a starting point for game creators and researchers to make educated judgements about including AI-driven dialogues into future gaming experiences.
